# Delivery-Time-Prediction

- Selected Ridge Regression with degree-3 polynomial features as the final model after testing Linear, Lasso, and KNN regressions.
- Achieved R² score of 0.9854, indicating excellent predictive accuracy across different traffic regimes.
- Feature engineering (e.g. Distance_Traffic, Weather_Weekend) and polynomial expansion were key to modeling non-linear effects.
- Ridge’s L2 regularization effectively handled multicollinearity, outperforming Lasso and KNN in robustness and consistency.
- Final model demonstrates strong potential for operational use in delivery time prediction systems.
